# TechDegree Unit 6 Project - Build a Content Scraper

## Purpose:
* Practice working in Node.js
* Practice finding and working with npm packages.
* Create a web scraper for products from a Treehouse [ecommerce site](http://shirts4mike.com/).
## Note:
* I generated all files from scratch.
## Goals:
* Design web scraper from scratch using [cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio).
* Go to [ecommerce site](http://shirts4mike.com/shirts.php) as entry point and navigate to all products.
* Grab data and store in CSV file using CSV generator [d3-dsv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-dsv).
* Handle errors appropriately.
